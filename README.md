# ML
To begin, we start by loading a file using its file path and store it as a variable. Next, we read the contents of the file and save them into another variable called "taxi_fare_stats." This variable contains all the necessary data for our task.

Then, we identify the feature we want to predict and assign it to the variable "y" (or "z"). The associated factors or predictors are stored in the variable "X" (or "W"), with their names stored as strings within a list.

After that, we import the DecisionTreeRegressor from the sklearn.tree module. We create an instance of this model and train it using the relevant data (X, y or W, z). By using the "fit" method, the model learns from the provided data.

Finally, we can utilize the model's "predict" property to make predictions based on ourÂ requirements.
